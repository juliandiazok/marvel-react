```

  
## Tech Stack

React, Redux, Styled Components, React-Router


## Functionalities

* Start with random characters. 
* Search for characters that start with a word in the navigation bar. 
* Search for characters that start with a word by URL (https://react-marvel-steel.vercel.app/?character={characterName}).
* Ability to add, remove and view favorite characters.
* Light mode and dark mode of view. 
* Fully responsive page. 
* Character details within a modal.


## Problems

For some reason, when implementing redux, the home page and the character search by URL bring up the required elements, and after a second, these are updated by another batch of random elements. This issue is still under investigation.
